# CSGO-Match-Notifier
Get notified when you find a match in CSGO

# This is far from finished
I recommend against using this at the current moment. I will work on it a bit here and there and try to improve it.

---

To run it currently all you have to do is compile it and add `+con_logfile matchOutput.log` to your CSGO Launch Options. Run the compiled EXE and put an audio file called `match.wav` into the same folder as the EXE, once a match is found that audio file will be played.
